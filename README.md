# Homemade Solution Guide to K's Analysis
This is the LaTeX code of solutions I (Mark) made for *Introductory Real Analysis* (by Kolmogorov and Fomin). I would rather call it God-K-solution.
This project will (hopefully) be joined by Grayson.

The "Notes" section is mainly maintained by Grayson.

The "Solution_Guide" section is mainly contributed by Mark.

When will these be completed? 

PS: If you find anything worth mentioning or noticing, email me at: fx355[at]nyu[dot]edu.
