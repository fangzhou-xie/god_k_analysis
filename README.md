# Homemade Solution Guide to K's Analysis
This is the LaTeX code of solutions I (Mark) made for Introductory Real Analysis (by Kolmogorov and Fomin). I would rather call it God-K-solution.
This project will (hopefully) be joined by Grayson.

The "Notes" section are mainly maintained by Grayson.
The "Solution_Guide" are mainly contributed by Mark.

When will these be completed?
